# Lab 01 - Mobile First

**Author**: Timea Heidenreich and Justin Morris

**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We created a blog to show off what we are about that is also easy to use, updated often and looks fantastic. We also wanted to create a familiar experience for our user so they can easily navigate our site and also access our blog on any screen they might be using.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The site was built using the best practice of HTML, CSS, and the jQuery library of javascript. 
- Our site uses a full-width template that is also responsive using CSS
- Using CSS, we also created a hamburger menu that displays when the user accesses site from a mobile device or when screen width is less than 640px
- Using jQuery, we created a dynamic menu that display when our hamburger menu feature is hovered over
